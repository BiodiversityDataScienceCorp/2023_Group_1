# Your species
# Cactus ferruginous pygmyowl (Claucidium brasilianum)
# Elizabeth's favorite species: Sonoran desert tortoise (Gopherus morafakai)
# The Sonoran desert tortoise is my favorite species. Desert tortoises are the engineers of the animal kingdom for their homes are used by a variety of species (up to ~3,000!). They also are great indicators of a healthy environment as they are long-lived animals that are sensitive to change, so when their population faces difficulties it can be an early indicator of an unhealthy environment. Sonoran desert tortoises are also, in my opinion, one of the cutest animals of the desert for they are laid back and munch on desert flowers when they are available. Their familiy also surived the asteroid crash 65 million years ago, so they are cool for that, too. 

# Abby's favorite species: Western bumblebee (Bombus occidentalis)
# The western bumble bee is my favorite of these animals. Bees are incredibly important members of the ecosystem. In their role as pollinators, they help support many different plants and animals by aiding plants in reproduction and then those plants in turn serve as food sources for different species. I also like the western bumble bee because of how cute it is. It’s incredibly fluffy and very round and I think that’s neat. 

# Molly's favorite species: My favorite species are blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus)
# My favorite animlas are blue whales because they have been coined the social giants of the ocean. Even though blue whales are the largest mammals on earth and in the Ocean, they dont consume other fish besides maybe on accident.This makes them first level consumers in their ecosystems. They are also social creatures and like to stick together. Unfourtunalty these animals are endangered speices because of over commerical hunting and their changing enviornments due to Climate Change. Another really cool fact about blue whales is that the sing to each other as way of communicating and those songs evolve as they are passed between populations. The songs originate on the west coast of Australia and then travel across the entire ocean before reaching the east coast.
