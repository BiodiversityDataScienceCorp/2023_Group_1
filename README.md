## 🐸 Overview 🐸 

#### 	The foothill yellow legged frog, **Rana Boylii** was first described by Baird in 1854. It is part of the kingdom Animalia, the phylum Chordata, the class Amphibia, the order Anura, and the family Ranidae. It is in a subgenus called pacific brown frogs, which consists of the northern red legged frog, the cascades frog, the California red legged frog, the Columbia spotted frog, the (northern) mountain yellow legged frog, the Oregon spotted frog, and the (southern) Sierra Nevada yellow legged frog. It is similar to the mountain and Sierra Nevada yellow legged frogs, but lives at different altitudes and has morphological differences. 
#### It is a medium sized frog, with webbing on its hind legs. Unlike other frogs, its skin has a distinctive rough texture. Its coloration is highly variable and can be gray, brownish, olive, and sometimes even red. The red coloring distinguishes it from the other yellow legged frogs, which don’t have a red phenotype. It has a light colored band on the top of its head. There is dark spotting on the throat and chest. The underside of the rear legs and abdomen are yellow, giving it its name.

#### The foothill yellow legged frog is found in riparian habitats. It is often found in streams and rivers with rocky substrate and sunny banks. These habitats are located in forests, chaparral, and woodlands. 
#### The original range of the frog was from Oregon, west of the cascades, down to southern California. It occurs with the red legged frog along the northern and central coasts of California.  Used to occur in southern california but doesn’t anymore. There are also some reports of an isolated population in south central california but that is thought to be extinct. Populations in California on the north coast and the northern Sierra Nevada are said to be the healthiest. Its range overlaps with the other yellow legged frogs, and with red legged frogs, all of whom are part of the same subgenus of pacific brown frogs. 

### This repository serves to examine occurrences and the current and future distributions of the **Rana Boylii** populations in North America. Data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), an open-access source of biodiversity data from several sources (including, but not limited to, iNaturalist, USGS, and museum collections), was utilized in this project.
