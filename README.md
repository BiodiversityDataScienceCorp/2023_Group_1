# Your species
# Cactus ferruginous pygmyowl (Claucidium brasilianum)
# Elizabeth's favorite species: Sonoran desert tortoise (Gopherus morafakai)
# The Sonoran desert tortoise is my favorite species. Desert tortoises are the engineers of the animal kingdom for their homes are used by a variety of species (up to ~3,000!). They also are great indicators of a healthy environment as they are long-lived animals that are sensitive to change, so when their population faces difficulties it can be an early indicator of an unhealthy environment. Sonoran desert tortoises are also, in my opinion, one of the cutest animals of the desert for they are laid back and munch on desert flowers when they are available. Their familiy also surived the asteroid crash 65 million years ago, so they are cool for that, too. 

# Abby's favorite species: Western bumblebee (Bombus occidentalis)
# The western bumble bee is my favorite of these animals. Bees are incredibly important members of the ecosystem. In their role as pollinators, they help support many different plants and animals by aiding plants in reproduction and then those plants in turn serve as food sources for different species. I also like the western bumble bee because of how cute it is. It’s incredibly fluffy and very round and I think that’s neat.
